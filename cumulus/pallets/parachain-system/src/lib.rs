//! `cumulus-pallet-parachain-system` is a base pallet for Cumulus-based parachains.
//!
//! This pallet handles low-level details of being a parachain. Its responsibilities include:
//!
//! - ingestion of the parachain validation data;
//! - ingestion and dispatch of incoming downward and lateral messages;
//! - coordinating upgrades with the Relay Chain; and
//! - communication of parachain outputs, such as sent messages, signaling an upgrade, etc.
//!
//! Users must ensure that they register this pallet as an inherent provider.
