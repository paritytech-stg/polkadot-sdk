title: '[Bot] Revive prdoc bot'
doc:
- audience: '123'
  description: |-
    Prdoc bot was deleted in https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5457 just after being added in https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5331 without replacement.
    Now bringing it back until it is integrated into the new command structure.

    Formatting is now also fixed, such that the title is always first and the description renders correctly.
